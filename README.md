# no-more-clown

ok so to use this install tampermonkey, then install a file of your choice in tampermonkey .  

TO INSTALL:
- literally just go into one of my files, copy all of the text, go to add script in tampermonkey, paste the whole thing in . tadaaaa .

for the clown replacer file you will have to go in and edit it in tampermonkey!! there are instructions in the file . alternatively you can leave it if you want pathetic wet cat wan sigma .

for the better clown file i guess you can still edit it ? but that one is really just to have nikolai bsd on screen cause hes the better clown bless him . its not any of his messed up pics dw hes just being goofy in it
